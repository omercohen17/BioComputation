## Ex 2
### Part A: Connected Sub-Graphs

This program generates connected sub-graphs of size n and counts the number of instances of each motif in a given graph and outputs the results to a textual file.

### Part B: Count Motifs
This program gets a given graph (from a txt file) and identifies sub-graphs of a specified size n. 
The program counts the number of instances for each motif and outputs the results to a textual file.

#### Usage

1. Download The main.py file
2. Open your terminal
3. Navigate to the directory where the file is located.
4. run the file by using a Python interpreter by this command:
```
python main.py
``` 
6. follow the prompt instructions
7. The output files name is depends the ex number:
   - In Part A: the results will appeare in `subgraphs_n.txt`, where 'n' is the size that you have entered in the prompt.
   - In Part B: the results will appeare in `count_motifs.txt`.
